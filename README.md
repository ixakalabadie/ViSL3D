# cube_x3d
The cube_x3d module can create X3D and HTML files to visualize data cubes from astrophysics in 3D, in an interactive way.<br/>
For now, the module includes, besides the defaults from the x3d-pathway, option to change the coordinate labels, show/hide galaxies, 
change colormap, change scale of V axis, include a 2D image, move the image along the V axis. Picking coordinates is also included but the coordinates 
it gives are not correct; does not result in errors in the final result though.
