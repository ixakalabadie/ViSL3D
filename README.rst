ViSL3D
======

Ixaka Labadie García 20/06/2025 - v0.4 — ``ViSL3D`` is a Python package
that creates X3D and HTML files to visualize datacubes from astrophysics
in 3D in an interactive way. We use
`X3D <https://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d>`__ and
`x3dom <https://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d>`__ to represent figures in
3D and to integrate them into an HTML. The models have been made taking
the x3d-pathway (Vogt et al. 2016) as a starting point. The current code
was made for radio data, although it can be used with other types of 3D
data.

`This is an
example <https://ixakalabadie.github.io/visualisations/HCG16_custom.html>`__
of a 3D visualisation produced with **ViSL3D**. It shows the HI emission
of the Hickson Compact Group 16 along an optical image from DSS2 and the
positions of the galaxies from NED.

Installation
------------

``pip install visl3d``

How to use
----------

Examples of how to use the package are provided in the Jupyter notebook
`jupyter_example.ipynb <https://github.com/ixakalabadie/cube_x3d/blob/master/example>`__.
The produced HTML file can be visualised in any standard browser.

Prerequisites to visualise external X3D file
--------------------------------------------

If you use the function ``createVis``, which creates integrates the X3D
model in the HTML, there are NO prerequisites. You can directly open the
produced HTML file in a browser. If you create the X3D and the HTML
files separately, using ``createX3D`` and ``createHTML``, follow these
instructions:

1. Install a local HTTP Server. Visualisations produced by **ViSL3D**
   must be opened through a local server in order to be displayed. There
   are a few options:

   - `Apache <https://httpd.apache.org/>`__ is a popular HTTP server
     that can be installed in most operating systems.
   - `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ has a built-in HTTP server
     that can be used by running ``python -m http.server`` in the
     directory where the HTML and X3D files are located.
   - `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ has a built-in HTTP
     server that can be used by installing the `Live
     Preview <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server>`__
     extension.

2. Move the created X3D and HTML files into the Apache (or other)
   DocumentRoot directory. By default, in Apache, it is
   ``/var/www/html`` in Linux, ``C:\Apache24\htdocs`` in Windows, and
   ``/usr/local/var/www`` (or similar) in Mac. The DocumentRoot can be
   found and modified in the ``httpd.config`` file. Finally, open the
   visualisation in a browser (most common browsers are supported) by
   typing the URL ``localhost\example_file.html``.

Features
--------

- Plot any number of contour surfaces,
- Plot galaxies with labels,
- Add a 2D image in any wavelength in background,
- Change the scale of the velocity axis,
- Shift 2D image along velocity axis and display the value,
- Rotate, zoom and pan complete figure,
- Hide/Show different components of the figure,
- Change ax labels,
- Change viewpoints,
- Change the colormap,
- Add markers,
- Represent multiple spectral lines in the same visualisation,
- Overlay spectral lines.

Disclaimer
----------

This package is in an early stage of development. It is not intended for
production use and may contain bugs or incomplete features. These are
some issues that you may encounter:

- Long loading time. If the 3D model is large the visualisation might
  take a long time to render or not render at all. In this case, try to
  make a cutout of the cube (can be done directly in ``ViSL3D``),
  decrease the resolution of the 3D model (also in ``ViSL3D``) or
  decrease the number of iso-surfaces or increase the S/N of the lowest
  surface.

- The animation stops after completing at least one loop. Do not click
  the button many times if you don’t see it stopping.

- The opacity feature does not work properly along the 2D image.

- The calculation of the RMS, which can be chosen as the unit to
  represent the cube, can be inaccurate. It uses negative voxels to
  create half a Gaussian and calculates the RMS from that. Therefore, if
  there is absorption or negative artifacts this calculation will be
  wrong. Another option is to calculate the RMS yourself and give it in
  the isosurfaces parameter, e.g., ``[3*rms, 5*rms...]``.
